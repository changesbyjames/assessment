This is a simple project that outlines some of the patterns that we use in a project.

This isn't a test and we aren't trying to catch you out. There aren't any deliberate bugs in the code or pull requests so we're not expecting you to fix anything. We aren't even expecting you to run this project, we just want to talk about your understanding of the code and your approach to communicating changes and pull requests.

This uses our standard stack of patterns and third party libraries without any styling to make it easier to focus on the code.
